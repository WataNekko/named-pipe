# NamedPipe

A wrapper for the .NET [NamedPipeServerStream](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.pipes.namedpipeserverstream) and [NamedPipeClientStream](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.pipes.namedpipeclientstream) object with a similar API to the [SerialPort](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.ports.serialport) class.

#### NOTE:

This was originally written to be used as the communication method between the drone and the controller in my [Unity3D VDrone](https://github.com/WataNekko/vdrone) project but was later discarded.
